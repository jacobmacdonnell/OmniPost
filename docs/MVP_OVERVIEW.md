## 1. Product Name

**OmniPost.ai**

## 2. Core Problem Solved

Content creators, marketers, and businesses often produce long-form content (blog posts, articles, reports) but struggle to efficiently repurpose it into engaging, platform-specific social media updates. This leads to missed opportunities for wider reach and inconsistent social media presence.

OmniPost.ai solves this by automating the transformation of long-form text into tailored social media posts for different platforms.

## 3. Target Audience

- Individual content creators (bloggers, writers, podcasters)
- Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with content marketing strategies
- Digital marketing professionals and agencies managing social media for clients

## 4. Key Features (MVP Scope)

The OmniPost.ai MVP will focus on a streamlined, core functionality to validate the primary value proposition:

- **Long-Form Content Input:** A simple web-based interface allowing users to paste or type in their long-form text content.
- **AI-Powered Content Transformation:** Utilizes advanced AI models (OpenAI GPT-4o) via an n8n automation backend to intelligently understand the provided text.
- **Platform-Specific Output Generation:** Automatically generates three distinct social media posts, each optimized for a specific platform:
    - **Twitter:** Concise, tweet-length text with relevant hashtags and emojis.
    - **LinkedIn:** Professional, insightful post suitable for business networking, with relevant hashtags.
    - **Instagram:** Engaging caption format, designed to accompany a visual (though no image generation/upload in MVP), with relevant hashtags and emojis.
- **Clear Output Display:** The generated posts are displayed clearly on the web interface, segmented by platform.
- **One-Click Copy:** Buttons allowing users to easily copy each generated post to their clipboard for manual pasting into their respective social media platforms.

## 5. Technology Stack (Internal MVP Detail)

- **Backend Automation:** n8n (for workflow orchestration and API integrations)
- **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o (or GPT-3.5 Turbo for cost-efficiency/speed)
- **Frontend:** Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (browser-based UI)
- **Local Deployment:** Docker (for easy setup and running of n8n)

## 6. Out of Scope for MVP (Future Considerations)

To maintain focus and deliver value quickly, the following features are explicitly **out of scope** for the MVP:

- User authentication or accounts
- Saving or history of generated posts
- Direct integration or posting to social media platforms (e.g., Twitter API, LinkedIn API)
- Advanced customization of AI prompts by the end-user
- Image generation or upload for Instagram posts
- Analytics or performance tracking
- Subscription management or payment processing
- Multi-user collaboration features
- API for third-party integrations

## 7. Value Proposition

- **Saving Time:** Eliminating the manual effort of writing multiple social media posts from long-form content.
- **Ensuring Consistency:** Providing tailored content that aligns with the nuances of each social media platform.
- **Boosting Reach:** Enabling users to easily distribute their content across diverse audiences.
