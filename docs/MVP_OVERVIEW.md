You're right, it's important to keep the overview document aligned with the development decisions!

Here's the updated Product Overview for OmniPost.ai, reflecting the change from Instagram to Threads and the decision to use v0.dev (implying a React/modern stack frontend) instead of "simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."

---

## **1. Product Name**

**OmniPost.ai**

## **2. Core Problem Solved**

Content creators, marketers, and businesses often produce long-form content (blog posts, articles, reports) but struggle to efficiently repurpose it into engaging, platform-specific social media updates. This leads to missed opportunities for wider reach and inconsistent social media presence.

OmniPost.ai solves this by automating the transformation of long-form text into tailored social media posts for different platforms.

## **3. Target Audience**

*   Individual content creators (bloggers, writers, podcasters)
*   Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with content marketing strategies
*   Digital marketing professionals and agencies managing social media for clients

## **4. Key Features (MVP Scope)**

The OmniPost.ai MVP will focus on a streamlined, core functionality to validate the primary value proposition:

*   **Long-Form Content Input:** A polished, web-based interface allowing users to paste or type in their long-form text content.
*   **AI-Powered Content Transformation:** Utilizes advanced AI models (OpenAI GPT-4o) via an n8n automation backend to intelligently understand the provided text.
*   **Platform-Specific Output Generation:** Automatically generates three distinct social media posts, each optimized for a specific platform:
    *   **Twitter:** Concise, tweet-length text with relevant hashtags and emojis.
    *   **LinkedIn:** Professional, insightful post suitable for business networking, with relevant hashtags.
    *   **Threads:** Engaging, text-focused post suitable for conversation, with relevant hashtags and emojis.
*   **Clear Output Display:** The generated posts are displayed clearly in distinct sections on the web interface, segmented by platform.
*   **One-Click Copy:** Buttons allowing users to easily copy each generated post to their clipboard for manual pasting into their respective social media platforms.

## **5. Technology Stack (Internal MVP Detail)**

*   **Backend Automation:** n8n (for workflow orchestration and API integrations)
*   **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o (or GPT-3.5 Turbo for cost-efficiency/speed during development)
*   **Frontend:** **React (generated with v0.dev), styled with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.**
*   **Local Deployment (n8n):** Docker (for easy setup and running of n8n)
*   **Frontend Development Environment:** Vite (or similar modern React bundler)

## **6. Out of Scope for MVP (Future Considerations)**

To maintain focus and deliver value quickly, the following features are explicitly **out of scope** for the MVP:

*   User authentication or accounts
*   Saving or history of generated posts
*   Direct integration or posting to social media platforms (e.g., Twitter API, LinkedIn API, Threads API)
*   Advanced customization of AI prompts by the end-user
*   Image generation or upload (especially relevant now that Instagram is out of scope for MVP posts)
*   Analytics or performance tracking
*   Subscription management or payment processing
*   Multi-user collaboration features
*   API for third-party integrations

## **7. Value Proposition**

OmniPost.ai's MVP delivers immediate value by:

*   **Saving Time:** Eliminating the manual effort of writing multiple social media posts from long-form content.
*   **Ensuring Consistency:** Providing tailored content that aligns with the nuances of each social media platform.
*   **Boosting Reach:** Enabling users to easily distribute their content across diverse audiences (Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads).
*   **Simplifying Workflow:** Offering a user-friendly and modern interface for AI-powered content repurposing without complex setups.
