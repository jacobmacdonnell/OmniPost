            - **Conciseness:** Each tweet in the thread must be concise and easy to read quickly, suitable for Twitter's fast-paced environment. While not every tweet needs to be at the character limit, avoid overly long sentences or paragraphs within a single tweet.
            - **Hashtags:** Use 2-3 relevant and targeted hashtags per tweet. Focus on hashtags derived from 'keyTopics' (like {{ ($('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.keyTopics && $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.keyTopics.length > 0) ? "'" + $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.keyTopics.join("', '") + "'" : "'relevant topics'" }}) and the identified 'industry' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.industry }}'). Avoid over-tagging.
            - **Tone:** Ensure a conversational and engaging tone, precisely adapted from the 'mainTone' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.mainTone }}').
            - **Actionable Value:** Include actionable takeaways or key points if present in the original content.
            - **Engagement CTA (Last Tweet):** End the thread with an engaging question or a clear call-to-action to encourage replies, retweets, or further discussion.
            - **Numbering:** Strictly number tweets in the thread using the format "1/X", "2/X", etc., where X is the total number of tweets in the thread. (e.g., 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4).
            - **Complexity Adaptation:** If 'estimatedComplexity' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.estimatedComplexity }}') is 'expert_level', you can touch on more nuanced points concisely. If it's 'beginner_friendly', ensure concepts are highly accessible and explained very simply.

            OUTPUT FORMAT (Reminder):
            If a single tweet: Just the tweet content.
            If a thread: Format as "1/X: [content]\n2/X: [content]\n..." with each tweet clearly delineated by the numbering and on new lines.`
            ```
    *   ✅ **C. Configure `OpenAI - Threads` Node (Refined):**

            ORIGINAL CONTENT TO TRANSFORM:
            {{ $('Prepare Input').item.json.longFormContent }}

            REQUIREMENTS:
            - **Emoji Integration:** Use emojis strategically and tastefully throughout the post to enhance visual appeal, convey emotion, and break up text. Ensure they align with the 'mainTone' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.mainTone }}') and 'contentType' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.contentType }}').
            - **Formatting for Engagement:** Ensure excellent readability with generous use of line breaks, thoughtful spacing between paragraphs or ideas. Utilize formatting like bolding for subheadings or key phrases to enhance readability and visual structure if appropriate. If the 'contentType' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.contentType }}') suggests lists (e.g., steps, tips, features), present them clearly using bullet points (e.g., • item) or numbered lists.
            - **Conversational Focus:** Prioritize storytelling, personal connection, or sparking a friendly conversation, guided by the 'mainTone' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.mainTone }}') and 'targetAudienceIntent' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.targetAudienceIntent }}'). Make it feel authentic and human.
            - **Hashtags:** Include 3-5 relevant and engaging hashtags. These should be integrated naturally within the text if possible, or grouped at the end. Draw from 'keyTopics' (like {{ ($('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.keyTopics && $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.keyTopics.length > 0) ? "'" + $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.keyTopics.join("', '") + "'" : "'community topics'" }}) and the identified 'industry' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.industry }}').
            - **Tone:** Maintain a friendly, approachable, and inviting tone, precisely adapted from the 'mainTone' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.mainTone }}').
            - **Interactive CTA:** End with a question or prompt specifically designed to encourage direct replies, share experiences, or start a community discussion.
            - **Complexity Adaptation:** If 'estimatedComplexity' ('{{ $('Content Analyzer').item.json.choices[0].message.content.estimatedComplexity }}') is 'expert_level', present insights in an accessible way. If it's 'beginner_friendly', keep the language exceptionally simple and inviting.

            OUTPUT FORMAT (Reminder):
            A single, well-formatted Threads post with emojis, clear paragraphs/sections, good spacing, and hashtags naturally integrated, ready for publishing. Ensure it reads as one continuous post, not a numbered series.`
            ```
    *   ✅ **D. Verify `Format [Platform]` Set Nodes:** (`Format Linkedin`, `Format Twitter`, `Format Threads`)
        *   ✅ Each node correctly takes the output from its respective `OpenAI - [Platform]` node.
        *   ✅ Value for the post field (e.g., `linkedinPost`, `twitterPost`, `threadsPost`) set to (Expression): `{{ $json.choices.message.content }}`.
    *   ✅ **E. Test Contextual Adaptation with "Blue Whales" Sample:**
        *   ✅ LinkedIn, Twitter, and Threads outputs demonstrate high-quality, platform-specific adaptation reflecting the content analysis and refined prompts.
    *   [ ] **F. Test with diverse content samples (2-3 more significantly different types of content).**
        *   Verify `Content Analyzer` provides appropriate, distinct analyses.
        *   Verify contextual adaptation continues to work effectively and with high quality for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Threads for these new content types.

    *   [ ] Test with non-English content (if applicable/desired)
    *   [ ] Add error handling in n8n for failed AI responses (review and implement; e.g., "Error Workflow Node" or "Continue on Fail" settings on nodes).
    *   [ ] Implement content length warnings (consider for frontend or n8n logic for user feedback).

---

### **Stage 2: Frontend Enhancement - User Control & Customization (Week 1-2)**
*(To be started after Stage 1 is robustly tested)*
#### **2.1 Content Input Enhancement**
*   [ ] **2.1.1 Smart Input Component**
    *   [ ] Add character counter with color coding (red <50, yellow 50-100, green >100)
    *   [ ] Add content type detection hint (potentially from a simplified frontend analysis or just UI)
    *   [ ] Add word count and estimated reading time
    *   [ ] Add paste formatting options (preserve/remove formatting)
*   [ ] **2.1.2 Content Validation**
    ```typescript
    // Add to frontend validation
    const validateContent = (content: string) => {
      if (content.length < 50) return { valid: false, message: "Content too short for quality generation" }
      if (content.length > 5000) return { valid: false, message: "Content too long, consider breaking into sections" } // Consider linking this to n8n's actual limits or token counts
      if (!content.trim()) return { valid: false, message: "Please enter content to transform" }
      return { valid: true }
    }
    ```

#### **2.2 User Customization Controls (Data to be passed to n8n workflow)**
*   [ ] **2.2.1 Tone Selection Component**
    ```typescript
    interface ToneOption { id: string; name: string; description: string; example: string; }
    const toneOptions: ToneOption[] = [
      { id: 'professional', name: 'Professional', description: 'Formal, business-focused, authoritative', example: 'Industry insights and strategic recommendations' },
      { id: 'casual', name: 'Casual', description: 'Friendly, conversational, approachable', example: 'Let\'s talk about this interesting topic...' },
      { id: 'expert', name: 'Expert', description: 'Technical, detailed, thought-leadership', example: 'Deep dive into implementation details' },
      { id: 'engaging', name: 'Engaging', description: 'Fun, attention-grabbing, memorable', example: 'You won\'t believe what happened next!' },
      { id: 'custom', name: 'Custom', description: 'Define your own tone', example: 'e.g., witty and sarcastic' } // Consider how 'custom' maps to n8n
    ];
    ```
    *   [ ] Create tone selector UI component (e.g., Shadcn Select/Radio Group).
    *   [ ] Pass selected tone ID (e.g., `userSelectedTone`) to n8n workflow.
    *   [ ] **n8n Adaptation:** Modify `Content Analyzer` or platform AI prompts to use `userSelectedTone` if provided, possibly overriding or influencing `mainTone` detection.
*   [ ] **2.2.2 Industry/Niche Selection**
    ```typescript
    const industries = [
      { id: 'technology', name: 'Technology', hashtags: ['#tech', '#innovation', '#digital'] },
      // ... (other industries as defined before) ...
      { id: 'other', name: 'Other/General', hashtags: ['#business', '#insights', '#tips'] }
    ];
    ```
    *   [ ] Create industry selector component.
    *   [ ] Pass selected industry ID (e.g., `userSelectedIndustry`) to n8n.
    *   [ ] **n8n Adaptation:** `Content Analyzer` can use this as a hint or override for `industry` detection. Platform AI prompts can directly use `userSelectedIndustry` for hashtag suggestions or contextual language.
*   [ ] **2.2.3 Platform Selection & Preferences**
    *   [ ] Allow users to choose which platforms to generate for (e.g., checkboxes for Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads).
        *   **n8n Adaptation:** Add logic (e.g., IF nodes) in n8n to only run branches for selected platforms.
    *   [ ] Platform-specific options (Example):
        ```typescript
        interface PlatformSettings {
          twitter: { enabled: boolean; threadMode: 'single' | 'thread' | 'auto'; maxTweets: number; };
          linkedin: { enabled: boolean; includeQuestion: boolean; hashtagCount: number; };
          threads: { enabled: boolean; emojiLevel: 'none' | 'minimal' | 'moderate' | 'high'; visualFormatting: boolean; };
        }
        ```        *   [ ] Implement UI for these settings.
        *   [ ] Pass these settings to n8n.
        *   [ ] **n8n Adaptation:** Modify platform AI User Messages to respect these settings (e.g., `If userSettings.twitter.threadMode === 'single'`, instruct AI to generate a single tweet).

#### **2.3 Enhanced Generation UI**
*   [ ] **2.3.1 Progressive Loading States**
    *   [ ] Show distinct loading messages for: "Analyzing content...", "Generating LinkedIn post...", etc.
*   [ ] **2.3.2 Real-time Preview (Advanced)**
    *   [ ] Show character counts for generated Twitter/Threads content.
    *   [ ] Basic platform compliance indicators (e.g., if a tweet is too long).
